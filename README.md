# Structured-Programming
Collection of Java actions by Conor Phelan
Hello! My name is Conor Phelan. I am a student currently studying Human Computer Interaction and User Experience at Maynooth University in Ireland.

Here you will find a collection of a range of different Java exercises I have completed. My learning of Java can be observed through the more simplistic exercises, to those that are more advanced. 

I have included two files for each exercise, signified by numbers. One number has a screenshot of the code itself, while the other has the question and in most cases, the terminal where the code is running. 

The aim of uploading this collection is to showcase my abilities in the field of Java programming.
